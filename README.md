# Greetings Slackers
This simple script written in basic Python will allow you to hook into the real time API of Slack and perform a direct message greeting to every new joiner!
Usually this is used to tell new joiners about the network, the guidelines, rules, useful links etc etc

# Q&A

## Q1. How do you change the welcome message?
A1.
To change the welcome message, edit your Heroku variables:
Go to Heroku's Settings, then  where it says `Config Variables` click `Reveal Config Vars` and it will reveal your message and other fields.  This will restart your Heroku instance pretty quickly and apply the changes for you

## Q2. How do I know if it worked?
A2.
After setting up the bot, your welcome message will be displayed to every new user, as soon as a they join your Slack network - as a direct message.
Check the example below:

## Q3. How do I enable the debug channel?
A3.
In the environment variables set DEBUG_CHANNEL_ID to be the ID of your chosen debug channel. That's usually achieved by using `export DEBUG_CHANNEL_ID=<YOUR SLACK CHANNEL ID>` in your CLI. We suggest to make this channel private so not just anyone can join it.


## Q4. How do I enabled the bot to forward messages sent to it? 
A4. You can tell your greeting bot to forward messages that users send to it to another channel. 

1. [Generate an API Token](https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens) for you slack workspace. Set the `SLACK_TOKEN` environment variable to the token. 

  ```
  export SLACK_TOKEN=<WORKSPACE API TOKEN>
  ```
  **Note:** This is a different token then the one needed to configure the bot
2. Create a channel for the bot to post and add the bot to the channel
3. Get the channel id for the channel. Set the `RESPONSE_CHANNEL` environment variable to this. 

  ```
  export RESPONSE_CHANNEL=<channel id>
  ```
  
After setting these variables, the bot will forward messages sent to it by copying the users `real_name` and message content and posting in the `RESPONSE_CHANNEL`. 

**Note:** the `real_name` is used since it is the only name field that always contains a name.
